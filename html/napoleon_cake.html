        <h3>Directions!</h3>
    <h4>Pastry Cream Filling</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large heatproof bowl, whisk egg yolks, cornstarch, salt, and 1/2 cup (99 g.) granulated sugar.</li>
        <li>In a medium pot over medium heat, heat milk and remaining 1/2 cup (98 g.) granulated sugar, stirring, until sugar is dissolved and milk is steaming. Whisking constantly, pour half of hot sugar milk into egg mixture. Pour milk-egg mixture into pot and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until pastry cream boils and thickens to a pudding-like consistency, 1 to 2 minutes. Cook, stirring, 1 minute more, then remove from heat. Stir in butter and vanilla. </li>
        <li>Pour hot pastry cream onto a rimmed baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap, pressing directly onto pastry cream. Refrigerate until cold.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Transfer cold pastry cream to another large bowl and stir until smooth. Stir one-quarter of whipped cream into pastry cream until combined. Using a rubber spatula, carefully fold in remaining whipped cream. Refrigerate pastry cream filling until ready to assemble.</li>
        <li>Make Ahead: Pastry cream (without whipped cream folded in) can be made 3 days ahead. Keep chilled.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Pastry Pastry Layers</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400° and line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Remove 1 sheet of puff pastry from refrigerator. On a lightly floured surface, roll out to a 13"-by-13" square. Cut square into 2 rectangles, transfer to prepared baking sheet, and prick all over with a fork. </li>
        <li>Bake, rotating sheet and flipping pastry halfway through, until deeply browned and crisp, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely.</li>
        <li>Repeat with remaining 3 sheets of puff pastry for a total of 8 pastry rectangles.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Assembly</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Stack 7 puff pastry rectangles on top of one another; set remaining 1 rectangle aside. Using a serrated knife, trim edges so rectangles are a uniform shape; reserve crumbs.</li>
        <li>Arrange 1 puff pastry rectangle on a platter. Spread 1 cup pastry cream filling over puff pastry rectangle; top with a second rectangle and spread with 1 cup filling. Repeat layering with 5 remaining rectangles and 5 cups filling. Cover sides of cake with remaining filling. </li>
        <li>Loosely cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate cake at least 4 hours or, preferably, up to overnight.</li>
        <li>Before serving, crush reserved puff pastry rectangle to fine crumbs, add to reserved crumbs, then press into sides and top of cake. Top with berries.</li>
    </ol>
